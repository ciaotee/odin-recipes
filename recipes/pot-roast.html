    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The best vegetable gravy you ever tasted — and the pot roast isn't bad
      either! We always had this meal with mounds of mashed potatoes to
      complement the delicious sauce. Great on a cold wintry evening!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ pounds tip round roast</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 onion, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <li>
        Spray slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. Season roast with salt
        and pepper. Place meat in the pot, fat side up. Pour tomato sauce over
        roast. Place onion over top. Toss in bay leaves. Cover and cook for 1
        hour on High.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 1 hour, reduce heat to Low and cook 6 to 8 more hours. Carefully
        lift meat out of the pot and remove to a warm platter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour drippings through a strainer into a medium-sized saucepan and
        discard material in the strainer. Whisk flour into the liquid. Cook,
        stirring constantly over medium heat until thickened. Season to taste
        with salt and pepper; serve alongside roast.
